Running the application:
	(1) Ensure that ports 3000 and 3001 are unused.
	(2) To run the backend:
		(a) Run XAMPP 8.0.28 (the same version installed in Assignment 4).
		(b) Run Apache and MySQL from XAMPP.
		(c) If this is the first time the application is being run:
			(i) Import the "weschedule_db.sql" file in phpMyAdmin.
			(ii) Ensure testuser exists and uses mypassword in phpMyAdmin (the same as in Assignment 4, so this may be done already)
			(iii) Execute "npm i" in the /backend folder.
		(d) Execute "npm start" in the /backend folder.
	(3) To run the frontend React dev server:
		(a) If this is the first time the application is being run:
			(i) Execute "npm i" in the /frontend folder.
		(b) Execute "npm start" in the /frontend folder.
	(4) To access the Swagger API Docs:
		(a) Navigate to http://localhost:3001/docs in a browser.
	(5) Using the frontend:
		(a) Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in a browser.
		(b) Sign up with an account with a valid email, name, and password, OR login with one of the following prebuilt accounts:
			email: admin				password: Password0!		This is the Global Admin account.
			email: aGroupOwner@test.com		password: Password0!
			email: aGroupMember1@test.com		password: Password0!
			email: aGroupMember2@test.com		password: Password0!
			email: aGroupMember3@test.com		password: Password0!
			
			Note: While your account information will be saved to the database, your session information is only stored in memory for this prototype, and any changes that cause the Express server to restart will discard session information, requiring you to log in again.
		(c) Once logged in, use the tabs at the top of the page to choose between the following views, and follow the instructions on the pages to create and manage groups and use the application's features:
			Topics
			

			Note that the length of input fields is restricted to 50 characters (~7-10 words) for event and topic names, 256 characters for user's names and separately for their emails, 20 characters for usernames, and 1000 characters (~140 words) for descriptions of events, topics, and logged points.

Additional Notes
	In order to avoid requiring the frontend to manage storage of the user's username, this information is retrieved from the server-side session data rather than sent as part of the resource identifier.
	Usernames are used in resource identifiers within groups so that no one but a user or a global admin may see the user's email address. If emails were used in resource identifiers, the emails of the users in a group would need to be sent to a group owner's client to configure operations that must refer to specific users.
	Usernames are prefered over autogenerated integer IDs for customizability.
